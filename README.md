# HackerGO

This repository contains early prototype assets for the HackerGO concept. The `Web-app demo` folder now includes a minimal web application that can be served locally.

## Running the MVP

1. Install Node.js (version 20 or later).
2. From the repository root, run:

   ```bash
   node server.js
   ```

3. Open `http://localhost:3000` in your web browser to see the app.

The server is intentionally lightweight and only serves the existing static pages as a proof of concept.
